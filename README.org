#+title: Org Reveal Enhancements


* MVP Goal

Use an org file to generate a simple presentation that uses [[https://revealjs.com/auto-animate/][RevealJS Auto-Animate]] with some SVG images.
There are some interesting ideas that could be presentated in a totally new way with this technology.

* Why?

Creating a solution to the above goal provides enough scope that will require learning more about org-mode, emacs lisp and how an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) works.

* Org-mode functions

- =org-element-parse-buffer=
- =org-element-property=
- =org-element-map=

* =ore.el=

=ore.el= is the project lisp package. It's very rough and doesn't solve the problem yet! Data structures are still being explored too.
